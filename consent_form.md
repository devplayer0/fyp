# Background of research

This project is based on research into enhanced
automated grading in your moduleâ€¯CSU11022 _Introduction to Computing II_.
Currently in this and the prior module _Introduction to Computing I_, automated
grading is employed in order to evaluate if your assignment submissions are
correct and able to produce the correct results for a given test case.

This
project seeks to develop a system which can provide feedback beyond whether or
not a program can produce the correct results. For example, the system might
analyse the types of instructions used (and whether their use is optimal), as
well as how long sections of the program take to run.

# Procedures of this study

This research project invites you to submit one or
more of your previous CSU11022 assignments online for the system to analyse.
You will then be able to see the results of the evaluation. Following this, you
will be asked to complete a short survey on the effectiveness and utility of the
system. Submission of assignments and completion of the survey should take no
more than 10 to 15 minutes in total. Each question in the survey is optional.
Feel free to omit a response to any question, but it would be much appreciated
all of the questions were answered.

# Publication

Aggregated responses to the survey may be published in the final report for the
project. Submitted code and associated performance results will not be
published.
