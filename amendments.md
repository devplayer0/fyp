1. In order to clarify the lack of reward for participation, as well as
   that no penalty would arise from not participating, statements explaining
   these facts have been placed together in the first paragraph of the
   information sheet. Previous statements on this scattered throughout the sheet
   have been removed.
2. The survey has been made entirely public without the requirement for a
   Google account (see new link).
