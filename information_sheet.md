You are invited to participate in a research project based on enhanced
automated grading in your moduleâ€¯CSU11022 _Introduction to Computing II_.
Your participation in this research is entirely voluntary. There is no
direct reward for participation, but it would be very much appreciated!
Please note that even if you agree to participate now, you can
withdraw at any time (up until submission of each part of the research described
below) without consequences of any kind.

Currently in CSU11022 and the prior module _Introduction to Computing I_, automated
grading is employed in order to evaluate if your assignment submissions are
correct and able to produce the correct results for a given test case. This
project seeks to develop a system which can provide feedback beyond whether or
not a program can produce the correct results. For example, the system might
analyse the types of instructions used (and whether their use is optimal), as
well as how long sections of the program take to run.

For this research you would be asked to submit one or
more of your previous CSU11022 assignments online for the system to analyse.
You will then be able to see the results of the evaluation. Following this, you
will be asked to complete a short survey on the effectiveness and utility of the
system. Submission of assignments and completion of the survey should take no
more than 10 to 15 minutes in total. Each question in the survey is optional.
Feel free to omit a response to any question, but it would be much appreciated
if all of the questions were answered.

We do not envisage any negative experiences or risks arising from your
participation in this research project. The lecturer will not be able to access
the performance results of your submissions. Only previously graded assignments
will be available for submission in the system. While there are no direct
benefits arising for participants, but we believe that this research will
benefit many future students in Introduction to Computing and potentially other
modules.

All information or data will be treated confidentially, as all submissions and
responses to the survey will be anonymous. Aggregated responses to the survey
may be published in the final report for the project.
