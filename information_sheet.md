You are invited to participate in a research project based on enchanced
automated grading in your moduleâ€¯CSU11022 _Introduction to Computing II_.
Currently in this and the prior module _Introduction to Computing I_, automated
grading is employed in order to evaluate if your assignment submissions are
correct and able to produce the correct results for a given test case.

This
project seeks to develop a system which can provide feedback beyond whether or
not a program can produce the correct results. For example, the system might
analyse the types of instructions used (and whether their use is optimal), as
well as how long sections of the program take to run.

Your participation in this research would be very much appreciated. Please note
that even if you agree to participate now, you can withdraw at any time without
any consequences of any kind. This research project invites you to submit one or
more of your previous CSU11022 assignments online for the system to analyse.
You will then be able to see the results of the evaluation. Following this, you
will be asked to complete a short survey on the effectiveness and utility of the
system. Submission of assignments and completion of the survey should take no
more than 10 to 15 minutes in total. Each question in the survey is optional.
Feel free to omit a response to any question, but it would be much appreciated
all of the questions were answered.

We do not envisage any negative experiences or risks arising from your
participation in this research project. The lecturer will not be able to access
the performance results of your submissions. Only previously graded assignments
will be available for submission in the system. Similarly, there are no direct
benefits arising for participants, but we believe that this important research
will benefit many future students in Introduction to Computing and potentially
other modules.

Your participation is entirely voluntary, and you can withdraw at any time from
(a) the online evaluation system and (b) the survey, up until the point at which
you submit both respectively.

All information or data will be treated confidentially, as all submissions and
responses to the survey will be anonymous. Responses to the survey may be
published in the final report for the project.
